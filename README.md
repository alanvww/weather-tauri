# React Weather Project

This is a React weather project that allows users to get the current weather information for a specific location. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface.

The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages React's component-based architecture to create reusable and modular components that make up the different parts of the weather application.

To get started with the project, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap.
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your API key as `REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key`.
6. Start the development server by running `npm start`.
7. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the weather application in action.

Feel free to explore the codebase and customize the project to suit your needs. Happy coding!
